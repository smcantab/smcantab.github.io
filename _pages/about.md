I am a postdoctoral associate working with Paul Chaikin at [NYU](https://as.nyu.edu/csmr.html) and Dov Levine at [Technion](https://phys.technion.ac.il/en/research/research-fields/complex-systems). My research is aimed at developing new strategies to tackle problems in nonequilibrium statistical physics. Typically I use computers to make progress in solving these problems.

I received an MPhil in Scientific Computing and a PhD in Theoretical Chemistry from the University of Cambridge where I worked with Daan Frenkel on the first direct test of the [Edwards conjecture](https://www.nature.com/news/intuition-harnessed-in-the-name-of-particle-packing-1.22199), among other exciting things.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.

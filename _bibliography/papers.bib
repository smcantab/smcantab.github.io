  author={Richards, Caryl Elizabeth and Anderson, Assaf Y and Martinani, Stefano and Law, ChunHung and O'Regan, Brian Coolidge},
  abstract={Electron transfer from TiO2 to iodine/iodide electrolytes proceeds via reduction of either I3– or uncomplexed I2 (free iodine), but which route predominates has not previously been determined. By measurement of the electron lifetime while independently varying free iodine or I3– concentrations, we find the lifetime is correlated with free-iodine concentration and independent of I3– concentration. This trend supports the hypothesis that electron recombination to the electrolyte occurs predominantly by iodine reduction rather than reduction of triiodide.},

  author={Magistris, Claudio and Martiniani, Stefano and Barbero, Nadia and Park, Jinhyung and Benzi, Caterina and Anderson, Assaf and Law, ChunHung and Barolo, Claudia and O'Regan, Brian},
  abstract={A NIR absorbing squaraine dye has been synthesized as a sensitizer for use in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Following computational calculations, a benz[cd]indole moiety was selected as an electron-rich heterocyclic component and condensed with indole-based emisquaraine bearing a carboxyl group, as an anchor for their immobilization on TiO2, to obtain an unsymmetrical squaraine with extended absorption due to its extensive π conjugation. The cells based on this dye exhibited a spectral response in the near-infrared region over 750 nm in addition to the visible region with a light absorption edge at 900 nm. The cells showed 1.1% efficiency and Incident Photon Current Efficiency (IPCE) of 36% at 800 nm.},

  author={Martiniani, Stefano and Stevenson, Jacob D and Wales, David J and Frenkel, Daan},
  abstract={The theoretical analysis of many problems in physics, astronomy, and applied mathematics requires an efficient numerical exploration of multimodal parameter spaces that exhibit broken ergodicity. Monte Carlo methods are widely used to deal with these classes of problems, but such simulations suffer from a ubiquitous sampling problem: The probability of sampling a particular state is proportional to its entropic weight. Devising an algorithm capable of sampling efficiently the full phase space is a long-standing problem. Here, we report a new hybrid method for the exploration of multimodal parameter spaces exhibiting broken ergodicity. Superposition enhanced nested sampling combines the strengths of global optimization with the unbiased or athermal sampling of nested sampling, greatly enhancing its efficiency with no additional parameters. We report extensive tests of this new approach for atomic clusters that are known to have energy landscapes for which conventional sampling schemes suffer from broken ergodicity. We also introduce a novel parallelization algorithm for nested sampling.},

  author={Ballard, Andy and Martiniani, Stefano and Stevenson, Jacob D. and Somani, Sandeep and Wales, David J.},
  abstract={We review a number of recently developed strategies for enhanced sampling of complex systems based on knowledge of the potential energy landscape. We describe four approaches, replica exchange, Kirkwood sampling, superposition‐enhanced nested sampling, and basin sampling, and show how each of them can exploit information for low‐lying potential energy minima obtained using basin‐hopping global optimization. Characterizing these minima is generally much faster than equilibrium thermodynamic sampling, because large steps in configuration space between local minima can be used without concern for maintaining detailed balance.},

  title={Turning intractable counting into sampling: computing the configurational entropy of three-dimensional jammed packings},
  author={Martiniani, Stefano and Schrenk, K Julian and Stevenson, Jacob D and Wales, David J and Frenkel, Daan},
  abstract={We present a numerical calculation of the total number of disordered jammed configurations Ω of N repulsive, three-dimensional spheres in a fixed volume V. To make these calculations tractable, we increase the computational efficiency of the approach of Xu et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 245502 (2011)] and Asenjo et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 098002 (2014)] and we extend the method to allow computation of the configurational entropy as a function of pressure. The approach that we use computes the configurational entropy by sampling the absolute volume of basins of attraction of the stable packings in the potential energy landscape. We find a surprisingly strong correlation between the pressure of a configuration and the volume of its basin of attraction in the potential energy landscape. This relation is well described by a power law. Our methodology to compute the number of minima in the potential energy landscape should be applicable to a wide range of other enumeration problems in statistical physics, string theory, cosmology, and machine learning that aim to find the distribution of the extrema of a scalar cost function that depends on many degrees of freedom.},

  journal={Physical Review E 93, 031301},
  abstract={We propose an efficient Monte Carlo method for the computation of the volumes of high-dimensional bodies with arbitrary shape. We start with a region of known volume within the interior of the manifold and then use the multistate Bennett acceptance-ratio method to compute the dimensionless free-energy difference between a series of equilibrium simulations performed within this object. The method produces results that are in excellent agreement with thermodynamic integration, as well as a direct estimate of the associated statistical uncertainties. The histogram method also allows us to directly obtain an estimate of the interior radial probability density profile, thus yielding useful insight into the structural properties of such a high-dimensional body. We illustrate the method by analyzing the effect of structural disorder on the basins of attraction of mechanically stable packings of soft repulsive spheres.},

  abstract={Machine learning techniques are being increasingly used as flexible non-linear fitting and prediction tools in the physical sciences. Fitting functions that exhibit multiple solutions as local minima can be analysed in terms of the corresponding machine learning landscape. Methods to explore and visualise molecular potential energy landscapes can be applied to these machine learning landscapes to gain new insight into the solution space involved in training and the nature of the corresponding predictions. In particular, we can define quantities analogous to molecular structure, thermodynamics, and kinetics, and relate these emergent properties to the structure of the underlying landscape. This Perspective aims to describe these analogies with examples from recent applications, and suggest avenues for new interdisciplinary research.},

  author={Martiniani, Stefano and Schrenk, K Julian and Ramola, Kabir and Chakraborty, Bulbul and Frenkel, Daan},
  abstract={In the late 1980s, Sam Edwards proposed a possible statistical-mechanical framework to describe the properties of disordered granular materials 1. A key assumption underlying the theory was that all jammed packings are equally likely. In the intervening years it has never been possible to test this bold hypothesis directly. Here we present simulations that provide direct evidence that at the unjamming point, all packings of soft repulsive particles are equally likely, even though generically, jammed packings are not. Typically, jammed granular systems are observed precisely at the unjamming point since grains are not very compressible. Our results therefore support Edwards’ original conjecture. We also present evidence that at unjamming the configurational entropy of the system is maximal.},

  author={Frenkel, Daan and Schrenk, K Julian and Martiniani, Stefano},
  abstract={Conventional Monte Carlo simulations are stochastic in the sense that the acceptance of a trial move is decided by comparing a computed acceptance probability with a random number, uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Here, we consider the case that the weight determining the acceptance probability itself is fluctuating. This situation is common in many numerical studies. We show that it is possible to construct a rigorous Monte Carlo algorithm that visits points in state space with a probability proportional to their average weight. The same approach may have applications for certain classes of high-throughput experiments and the analysis of noisy datasets.},

  title={Quantifying hidden order out of equilibrium},
  abstract={While the equilibrium properties, states, and phase transitions of interacting systems are well described by statistical mechanics, the lack of suitable state parameters has hindered the understanding of non-equilibrium phenomena in divers settings, from glasses to driven systems to biology. Here we introduce a simple idea enabling the quantification of organization in non-equilibrium and equilibrium systems, even when the form of order is unknown. The length of a losslessly compressed data file is a direct measure of its information content. Here we use data compression to study several out-of-equilibrium systems, and show that it both identifies ordering and reveals critical behavior in dynamical phase transitions. Our technique should provide a quantitative measure of organization in systems ranging from condensed matter systems in and out of equilibrium, to cosmology, biology and possibly economic and social systems.},

@phdthesis{martiniani2017complexity,
  title={On the complexity of energy landscapes: algorithms and a direct test of the Edwards conjecture},
  author={Martiniani, Stefano},
  abstract={When the states of a system can be described by the extrema of a high-dimensional function, the characterisation of its complexity, i.e. the enumeration of the accessible stable states, can be reduced to a sampling problem. In this thesis a robust numerical protocol is established, capable of producing numerical estimates of the total number of stable states for a broad class of systems, and of computing the a-priori probability of observing any given state. The approach is demonstrated within the context of the computation of the configurational entropy of two and three-dimensional jammed packings. By means of numerical simulation we show the extensivity of the granular entropy as proposed by S.F. Edwards for three-dimensional jammed soft-sphere packings and produce a direct test of the Edwards conjecture for the equivalent two dimensional systems. We find that Edwards’ hypothesis of equiprobability of all jammed states holds only at the (un)jamming density, that is precisely the point of practical significance for many granular systems. Furthermore, two new recipes for the computation of high-dimensional volumes are presented, that improve on the established approach by either providing more statistically robust estimates of the volume or by exploiting the trajectories of the paths of steepest descent. Both methods also produce as a natural by-product unprecedented details on the structures of high-dimensional basins of attraction. Finally, we present a novel Monte Carlo algorithm to tackle problems with fluctuating weight functions. The method is shown to improve accuracy in the computation of the ‘volume’ of high dimensional ‘fluctuating’ basins of attraction and to be able to identify transition states along known reaction coordinates. We argue that the approach can be extended to the optimisation of the experimental conditions for observing certain phenomena, for which individual measurements are stochastic and provide little guidance.},
